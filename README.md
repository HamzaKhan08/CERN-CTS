### CERN Control Tools Suite (CTS) is a CERN-inspired, enterprise-grade full-stack web application designed to simulate how large-scale scientific experiments and power converter systems are monitored, managed, and analyzed in real operational environments.

### This project focuses on real-time data visualization, system reliability, structured workflows, and role-based access control, reflecting the principles used in research-driven organizations like CERN.

# 🚀 Overview

### CTS provides a unified control platform consisting of two core modules:

### 🔬 Experiment Monitoring Dashboard

### A real-time monitoring system that visualizes experiment sensor data such as temperature, voltage, beam intensity, and pressure. It supports live updates, historical analysis, threshold-based alerts, and scientific data visualization.

### ⚡ Power Converter Health Tracking System

### A structured system to track power converter status, faults, severity levels, maintenance history, approval workflows, and audit logs to ensure operational reliability and traceability.

# ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Real-time sensor data streaming using WebSockets

### 📈 Interactive charts and historical trend analysis

### 🚨 Threshold-based alerts and notifications

### ⚡ Power converter fault and maintenance tracking

### 🔐 Role-based access control (Admin, Scientist, Engineer, Operator, Supervisor)

### 🧾 Approval workflows with full audit trails

### 🛠 Administrative control panel for user and system management

### 🧩 Modular, scalable, and clean architecture

### 🐳 Fully containerized using Docker

# 🧠 Architecture

### CTS follows a modern full-stack architecture:

### Frontend: Vue 3 (Composition API), Pinia, Vite, ECharts

### Backend: FastAPI (async), Pydantic, SQLAlchemy

### Database: PostgreSQL

### Realtime: WebSockets

### DevOps: Docker & Docker Compose

### The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and reliability, with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and data layers.

# 🎯 Purpose & Motivation

### CTS is not a generic dashboard project. It was built to understand and demonstrate how operational tools are designed for scientific infrastructures, where correctness, clarity, and reliability are critical.
### The project aligns with CERN’s mission of supporting scientific discovery through robust and well-engineered software systems.

# 📌 Future Enhancements

### Integration with real experimental or IoT data sources

### AI-based anomaly detection and predictive maintenance

### Advanced analytics and reporting

### Kubernetes-based deployment

# 📄 License

### This project is for educational and demonstration purposes, inspired by CERN-style operational systems.
